# 👋 Hi, I'm Andrew

I'm a Computer Science PhD specializing in **audio processing**, **multimodal retrieval**, and **machine learning systems**.  
These days, I enjoy building **AI-powered Telegram bots**, working on **quantitative trading tools**, and exploring **computer vision** + **LLM agent workflows**.

I also love photography (Sony A6700), gaming, and flying my drone.  
This GitHub is a mix of research code, practical ML pipelines, and personal side-projects
